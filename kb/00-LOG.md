## 2026-06-18 19:41 ET — S2 FOMC×ZQ free-data first cut: structure validated (n=1), worth the CME spend

Free-data, single-meeting first cut of S2 on the just-resolved June 2026 FOMC — Kalshi PUBLIC historical
candlesticks (`yes_ask` BBO) × free Yahoo ZQ. `scripts/fomc_zq_basis_s2.py`, `findings/2026-06-18-fomc-zq-s2.md`.
**n=1 STRUCTURE check, NOT an edge.**

- **FOMC bracket overround = mean +3.35¢** (3–4¢) vs the **~10¢** weather overround that killed pt1/S1/S5 →
  **~3× cleaner; the prob-to-prob structural thesis HOLDS** — the reason S2 is the post-weather pivot.
- June was **LOW-INFORMATION**: both venues priced a near-certain hold (Kalshi P(hold) 0.942–0.962, ZQ
  0.931–0.977); net-of-fee basis mean **−1.39¢/contract**, 5/163 periods positive → no tradeable gap on THIS
  event (expected for a consensus hold; one event can't yield a CI).
- **Verdict: structure worth the CME spend.** Full version needs intraday ZQ ticks (daily close too coarse —
  ZQ P(hold) swung 0.931→0.977 on a single 1-tick move; the `N_post` divisor amplifies it) + many **contested**
  meetings + block-bootstrap CI (block=meeting) + Kalshi L2 depth + frozen-pre-position risk modeling. GATED on
  Ryan (CME data sourcing).
- Honesty: `yes_ask.close` tagged `real_ask` (BBO-at-candle-close caveat — overstates fillable size); ZQ-prob
  `synthetic`. Prior-contested-meeting pull deferred (2025 tickers use a different target-range scheme +
  rate-limits), not faked. **53 tests green, invariants --full green.** Tape/DB untouched.

## 2026-06-18 19:40 ET — 3 new cross-venue basis candidates drafted (S7/S8/S9) via /first-principles

Ideation pass through the **cross-venue basis lens** (Kalshi vs a different venue pricing the same/
correlated resolution). Goes BEYOND S2 (FOMC×ZQ prob-to-prob). All three grounded in live
settlement-spec + data-access research (Perplexity, 2026-06-18; CF Benchmarks RTI, Polymarket CLOB
docs, Kalshi historical candlestick REST). None is in the dead ledger.

- **S7 — KXBTC vs Polymarket crypto: settlement-index + sampling mismatch.** Kalshi KXBTC/KXETH
  hourly brackets settle on **CF Benchmarks RTI = 60s average of a multi-exchange index**;
  Polymarket crypto settles on a **single-exchange (Binance) 1-min candle / last print**. Same
  nominal hour, different fixing → the two venues' implied "price lands in bracket X" can disagree
  whenever Binance basis vs the multi-exchange index, or a sub-minute spike, moves the single print
  off the 60s mean. Mechanism: settlement mismatch, NOT a probability claim. Both real-price histories
  are FREE/public (Kalshi `/historical/market_candlesticks` yes-OHLC; Polymarket CLOB
  `/prices-history` + Gamma resolved outcome). Overround note: crypto-hourly binaries are 2-outcome
  (low overround) BUT Kalshi crypto taker fee is the fat 7%-class — must clear that.
- **S8 — Kalshi single-game sports vs Pinnacle sharp closing line (directional on the laggard).**
  Documented: Kalshi order-book sports prices LAG Pinnacle's vig-removed line by minutes after a
  discrete info shock (injury/scratch/steam); practitioner reports 2–3pp gaps before catch-up;
  election-market analog measured 12–18 min lag. Mechanism: sharp dealer (Pinnacle) reprices
  instantly; Kalshi only moves when a taker crosses the book → exploitable catch-up window. Trade
  the laggard (Kalshi) directionally toward the devigged Pinnacle number. Real ask = Kalshi BBO
  (candlestick yes_ask OHLC + live book); reference = Pinnacle/odds-API devig. Overround: liquid
  marquee games show 1–3¢ spreads — thin enough that a 2–3pp lag can clear it.
- **S9 — Kalshi vs Polymarket same-event PRICE-DISCOVERY lead-lag (timing, not static level).**
  "Who Wins and Who Loses" (SSRN) + LOOP-violation paper: **Polymarket leads Kalshi in price
  discovery** (24/7 crypto crowd, zero maker fee) on the SAME politics/macro yes/no event; the
  static level-wedge has compressed to 1–2% and is NOT cleanly unidirectional, so the edge is the
  *timing* — fade Kalshi toward Polymarket's already-moved price after a discrete shock, not a
  standing level arb. Mechanism: segmented user bases + USDC/USD rail friction keep arbitrage from
  enforcing instant parity. Both prices FREE (Kalshi candlestick + Polymarket CLOB). Overround:
  Kalshi politics binaries are richer (sum 110–140% multi-outcome); the lead-lag must clear Kalshi's
  taker fee + spread on the 2-outcome legs.

These graduate to the registry as **S7/S8/S9 (idea)**. Binding tests are all no-capital replays on
free public history. Returned via the workflow's StructuredOutput; full rationale in the council/
first-principles brief to follow before any data-collection spend.

## 2026-06-18 15:03 ET — S5 weather rehab TESTED → DEAD. Weather family is dead at real asks.

**The decisive result.** With Ryan's go-ahead, ran the S5 weather-rehab real-ask paper test —
the question that decides the project's direction. Verdict: **the weather family is DEAD at real
asks, even with proper EMOS calibration.** (`scripts/weather_rehab_s5.py`,
`findings/2026-06-18-weather-rehab-s5.md`, per-trade dump `reports/weather_rehab_s5_full.json`.)

- **EMOS works — but it's necessary, not sufficient.** Leave-one-day-out EMOS calibration cut
  pooled CRPS **2.366 → 2.180 (−7.86%)**, fixing the underdispersion exactly as the literature
  (Gneiting 2005) predicts. The better probability is real.
- **The dollar edge is not.** 641 trades (3-model ensemble: GFS+ECMWF-IFS025+ICON; GEM single-runs
  not archived for the window so honestly dropped → member_count=3; no `ncep_gefs025`). Mean net
  **−$0.02789/trade**, 95% moving-block-bootstrap CI **[−$0.06297, +$0.00788]** (n_boot=10k, 21
  contract-day blocks). **Lower bound does NOT clear zero.** Killed by the same **~9.8¢ mean
  overround** that ate pt1 and S1. A better probability cannot beat a ~10¢ structural tax here.
- **Adversarial checks (the discipline that matters):** edge-bar sweep — raising the conviction bar
  to 0.10/0.15 made P&L *worse* (CI fully below zero), the opposite of a real edge; independent
  fill/cost sign audit — 0 mismatches (no repeat of S1's near-miss); anti-leak — used the Open-Meteo
  **Single Runs API pinned to (D−1) 00Z** (a genuine ~24h-ahead leak-free forecast), NOT the
  historical-forecast archive (which stitches lead≈0 ≈ actuals and would leak — venues.yaml warns);
  0 leak-guard drops. Prices `real_ask`, all 6 provenance fields persisted per trade.
- Caveats (honest): short 22-day spring window, EMOS data-thin, decision time near market open,
  L1-only fills (haircut modeled not measured).

**PROJECT DIRECTION CHANGE:** weather is no longer "on probation" — it is **proven dead at real
asks**. The 3 weather angles tried (raw ensemble pt1, longshot-fade S1, EMOS-calibrated S5) are all
dead to the overround. **Pivot to non-weather: S2 (FOMC×ZQ basis — structurally NO bracket
overround), S3 (cross-strike staleness), S6 (market-making — earn the spread instead of paying it).**

Verified: **53 tests green, `invariants --full` + `--db` green**, recovered tape read-only. S5
committed to `main`. Only S2 (FOMC×ZQ) remains on the queue — GATED on CME data sourcing (Ryan).

## 2026-06-18 12:53 ET — S1 longshot-fade FALSIFIED · EMOS reproduced · forecast tape live

Three parallel probes ran on top of the S0 substrate (autonomous `/loop`, 3 subagents). Merged
tree verified: **53 tests green, `invariants --full` green**, recovered tape DB untouched (read-only).

- **S1 longshot-fade → DEAD (real asks).** n=990 reconstructed-`real_ask` KXHIGH brackets from the
  24GB recovered tape. The favorite-longshot bias *exists* (longshots <0.20 realize fewer wins than
  priced, gaps −1.4¢..−7.0¢; favorites >0.65 underpriced) but is single-digit cents, **swamped by a
  +9.84¢ mean overround**. Maker-NO-on-longshot net P&L **+$0.00448/trade, 95% block-bootstrap CI
  [−$0.00486, +$0.01333]** — lower bound does NOT clear zero; sweep 0.05→0.25 uniformly null, deepest
  longshots negative. **A whole bias-chasing family falsified**, as the dossier predicted. Probe:
  `scripts/longshot_fade_probe.py`; writeup: `findings/2026-06-18-longshot-fade-s1.md`. **Near-miss:**
  the first run cleared zero on a cost-model sign bug (maker entry booked as a 2¢ *improvement* not a
  *cost* — the exact pt1 prime-directive failure mode); caught + fixed. **Candidate invariant filed:**
  a cost haircut must never move the entry in the trader's favor. (Tape caveat: T-24h lands near market
  open; L1-only, fill-prob haircut modeled not measured; single 22-day spring window.)
- **EMOS reproduced (#5).** `scripts/emos_demo.py` (stdlib-only, deterministic) fits a 1-param-spread
  EMOS Gaussian by minimizing closed-form Gaussian CRPS: **CRPS 1.663 (raw ensemble) → 0.717 (EMOS),
  −56.9%**, bracket P(74≤Tmax<78)=0.761. Flipped `kb/quant-finance/01-weather-forecasting-alpha.md`
  from `cited` → `reproduced`. (Calibrated post-processing beats the raw underdispersed ensemble — the
  precondition for any S5 weather-rehab attempt.)
- **Forecast tape now exists (#3).** `collection/forecast_collector.py` (+10 offline tests) — single
  read-only Open-Meteo pass per city × {gfs_seamless, ecmwf_ifs025, icon_seamless, gem_global} (NO
  `ncep_gefs025`, Hard Rule #1, with a runtime guard), append-only JSONL with ms `fetch_ts` + raw
  sha256 + `source_tag=synthetic`, honest completeness. Live smoke (NYC, 2026-06-18): 89.6/89.2/90.1/
  86.3°F across models. The previously-zero most-reused missing input is no longer zero.
  **Scheduling still GATED** (laptop-cron HOLD).

**Loop end-state:** all 4 unblocked Next items done (S0 substrate, S1, EMOS, forecast collector). **Two
items remain GATED on Ryan:** #2 cron forward capture (Kalshi creds + the laptop-cron HOLD decision)
and #4-S2 FOMC×ZQ (CME data sourcing). Nothing committed to git (Ryan's call).

## 2026-06-18 12:38 ET — S0 real-ask substrate built + Hard-Rule invariants (43 tests green)

**Built the project's first implementation — the substrate every future edge is scored on
(dossier #1, the canonical first build).** Autonomous `/loop` run against the 5-item Next queue.

- **Lifted verbatim from `kalshi.1` @ `fd37ae2`** (byte-identical, all 16 files diff-checked,
  recorded in `../PROVENANCE.md`): `core/{canonical,io,manifest_schema,timeutil,schema}.py`,
  `collection/{normalize,capture_orderbooks}.py`, `validation/{v1_actuals,v3_market,_http}.py`,
  4 config YAMLs, 3 tests + ticker fixture. Mirroring kalshi.1's layout meant **zero import edits**.
  - `normalize.py` derives the REAL taker ask `best_yes_ask = round(1 − best_no_bid, 4)` (Kalshi
    posts bids-only; the ask is the opposite side's complement). This is the price H1 trades on.
  - `capture_orderbooks.py` = forward, read-only, bitemporal depth capture Kalshi does NOT archive
    (the only moat that compounds with calendar time). Honest completeness: a dropped market lowers
    `n_markets < expected` so a truncated pass can't pass as complete (survivorship guard).
  - `v1_actuals.py` = 3-source settlement gate (CLI vs METAR vs GHCN) — the corrupted-actuals catch.
- **Authored fresh for THIS project's rules** (kalshi.1 has no equivalent — its invariants are
  arb-bot-v2's, scoped to a different layout):
  - `scripts/invariants.py` — the **6 Hard Rules** as static (regex) + DB (sqlite) assertions, plus
    `--pre-edit-hook` mode. Structure adapted from `arb-bot-v2/scripts/v3_invariants.py`, retargeted.
    DB invariants are **schema-discovering** (the project's DB schema isn't frozen) — they introspect
    tables, so Rule #4 (no pnl without a `price_source_tag`) fires on whatever backtest table appears.
  - `core/source_tag.py` — the trust=FALSE default in code: **untagged number ⇒ `synthetic`**; only
    `real_ask`/`broker_truth` are `is_fillable`; `require_fillable()` blocks synthetic/midpoint from
    any fill/P&L decision (prime directive #1).
  - `core/pricing.py` — THE sanctioned `yes_ask/bracket_sum` site (Hard Rule #3); `overround()` makes
    the ~5¢ pt1 killer a first-class, persisted number.
  - `core/stats.py` — `safe_pstdev` with the n≥4 guard (Hard Rule #2).
- **Verified:** `pytest -q` → **43 passed**; `invariants.py --full` → **all green**. The dossier's #1
  binding assertion is now a test: `best_yes_ask == round(1 − best_no_bid, 4)`, ask stamped `real_ask`.
- **Not wired (left for approval):** the PreToolUse hook (would block edits = harness change); live
  capture/actuals paths (need Kalshi creds + network — only offline/injected paths are tested).

**Next (this loop):** `scripts/emos_demo.py` repro (#5) → Open-Meteo collector script (#3) →
longshot-fade offline calibration on the recovered tape (#4-S1). **GATED on Ryan:** cron the forward
capture (#2 — needs creds + conflicts with the kalshi.1 laptop-cron HOLD) and FOMC×ZQ (#4-S2 — needs
CME data sourcing).

## 2026-06-18 01:10 ET — Codebase mine landed; KB foundations built

**Workflow result (27 agents, 22 candidates, all adversarially verified at real asks):**
- Verdict tally: **0 proven edges · 4 dead · 6 infra-only · 12 needs-data.**
- Honest bottom line: **no clean dollar edge is proven at real fillable asks anywhere.** The
  only real-money test (KXHIGH weather ensemble, n=49) lost −$0.14/trade; pt1 −9.6%, killed by
  ~3–5¢ bracket overround. Directional signal is real; dollar edge is not.
- Cheapest path forward: build the **real-ask substrate** (S0: tape capture + 3-source actuals
  gate + bid-only ask primitive + invariant engine), start **archiving forward orderbook tape**
  (un-backfillable; the only moat that compounds), and run two near-free probes — **longshot-fade
  calibration (S1)** and **FOMC×ZQ basis (S2)**. Zero weather-model capital until a real-ask CI clears zero.
- Full dossier → `../findings/2026-06-18-codebase-money-map.md`. Candidates registered → `strategies/00-index.md`.

**KB built this session:**
- `kalshi-api/`: overview, **auth & signing** (RSA-PSS/SHA-256, verified), REST+WebSocket map,
  **fees & breakeven** (`reproduced` via `scripts/fee_breakeven.py` — 2¢/contract at 0.50 → need +2¢ edge).
- Runnable repros: `scripts/kalshi_sign.py` (local signature verifies OK), `scripts/fee_breakeven.py` (ran).
- `quant-finance/`: 7-theme overview + deep weather-alpha note; citations triaged (caught a
  fabricated arXiv id + several wrong venues — see `_sources/quant-finance-sources.md`).
- `glossary.md`, both `_sources/` provenance files.

**Dead-end ledger (do not re-mine):** raw KXHIGH ensemble as deployed, Kelly-modifier tilt, LIP
rebate harvest, settle-time T-3h pin, K1' "hedge" framing, NWS/WU settle-source basis. (Details in dossier.)

**Next:**
1. Build S0 substrate (lift kalshi.1 `normalize.py`/`v1_actuals.py`/`capture_orderbooks.py` + invariants).
2. Cron forward Kalshi orderbook capture at a pinned decision time TODAY.
3. Start an Open-Meteo forecast collector (zero forecast tape exists anywhere — most-reused missing input).
4. Run S1 (longshot-fade) and S2 (FOMC×ZQ one-meeting) — near-free, no capital, decide weather's fate.
5. Reproduce: write `scripts/emos_demo.py` so the weather-alpha note can claim `reproduced`.

## 2026-06-18 00:35 ET — KB seeded; codebase-mining workflow launched

- Created `kalshi.headless` as the canonical Tier-2 Kalshi project. Inherited the
  prime directive, trust=FALSE defaults, and 6 hard rules from `arb-bot` (see
  `../CLAUDE.md`).
- Stood up this KB with the Karpathy-method charter (`README.md`): first
  principles, runnable repros, append-only log, cold-reader legibility.
- Kicked off a dynamic workflow to mine the four existing Kalshi codebases
  (`arb-bot`, `arb-bot-v2`, `kalshi.1`, `kalshi.ibkr`) for money-making
  opportunities and adversarially verify each against the "real fillable asks"
  bar. Output lands in `../findings/`.
- Began two foundational KB tracks in parallel:
  - `kalshi-api/` — how Kalshi actually works (auth, market structure, fees,
    rate limits, data).
  - `quant-finance/` — peer-reviewed literature relevant to prediction-market
    edges (calibration, favorite-longshot bias, market microstructure, Kelly).

**Next:** integrate workflow findings into `strategies/` candidates; reproduce
the top-1 fee/pricing claim with a runnable script.
